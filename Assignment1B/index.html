            Italy exudes romance, from its breathtaking cities to its sun-kissed
            coast. It is a country that is world-renowned for its delicious
            culinary offerings and incredible wine, a place where centuries of
            history combines with fashion, art, and modern luxuries. Experience
            the wonder of Italy by train to explore the country's top
            destinations and to fall in love with the Italian culture. Italy
            tours feature cities such as Rome, Florence, Sorrento, Milan, Naples
            and Venice, and seaside destinations along the Amalfi Coast.
            Travelers may even experience the Old World charms of Sicily during
            their Italian adventure. In Rome, visit St. Peter's Square, see the
            Colosseum and Roman Forum, climb the Spanish Steps, and make a wish
            in the Trevi Fountain. Take time to relax in one of the city's many
            piazzas, enjoying some gelato or espresso while soaking in the
            ambiance. In Florence, visit the traditional leather markets, see
            Michelangelo's David at the Galleria dell'Accademia and seek out the
            Medici Chapel. Enjoy a romantic canal cruise in Venice or walk
            through St. Mark's Square to admire the intricate basilicas. Visit
            the island of Murano for some delicate glass souvenirs or travel by
            rail to the ruined city of Pompeii. Relax in Sorrento, the perfect
            place to begin your explorations of the colorful Amalfi Coast.
